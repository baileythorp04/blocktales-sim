# code fixes

move a bunch of logic in combat page into Game

# bugs

going into battle with SP saver, going back, and going into combat again reduces SP of dynamite by 2

# game features

store/restore game and log from file

more log granularity?

true infinite first stike and feelfine/pierce

# inaccuracies

no rolling HP
death/res happens instantly; an enemy's multihit will hit you after being res'd
pirate ghost alternates coin/barrel attacks instead of being random
softener just removes defUP rather than causing defDOWN

# trotter notes:

defend 20% reduction works
defend always rounds down
minimize -2 does not work

for strategy it seems like 1 def isnt doing much. should have 0 or 1. firebrand deals same to def+half and sleep+half with 1 def or not
