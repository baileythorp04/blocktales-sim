# game fixes

true infinite first stike and feelfine/pierce

# game features

log (show user+enemy actions each turn, separated by turn)

items
- slateskin
- ghost burger?
- medkit
- healing/sp item


make diagram of how an action works, with a line down the middle: card > action > deal damage > take damage > lose hp

# trotter notes:
defend 20% reduction works
defend always rounds down
minimize -2 does not work

for strategy it seems like 1 def isnt doing much. should have 0 or 1. firebrand deals same to def+half and sleep+half with 1 def or not
