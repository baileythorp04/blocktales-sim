# code fixes

throw you back to battle prep on combat refresh
    (stuff breaks when you rerender combat)

way advanced: instead of calling the whole list every time, just have the timed functions be altered at start of combat to the correct effects

add a reusable function for iterating through all cards of a given type


# game fixes

add list of chosen passive cards to combat UI

fix strict mode (probably) useeffect triggering all start of combat effects twice

remember: def-up status cant be pierced by sword's half pierce
if needed for softener, implement defup/defdown countering

# game features

log (show user+enemy actions each turn, separated by turn)
status effects (show in UI, apply statuses, make statuses do anything)
trotter stances
