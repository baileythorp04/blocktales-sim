# code fixes

throw you back to battle prep on combat refresh
    (stuff breaks when you rerender combat)

way advanced: instead of calling the whole list every time, just have the timed functions be altered at start of combat to the correct effects

add a reusable function for iterating through all cards of a given type


# game fixes

add list of chosen passive cards to combat UI

# game features

for restart/undo, try passing player/enemy factory functions instead of the player itself so you dont have to clone

account for 2+ first strike dmg

make trotter stance work with ball's second hit (make end-of-action systems for stance change and leech)
trotter 50% hp effect
log (show user+enemy actions each turn, separated by turn)
items

make diagram of how an action works, with a line down the middle: card > action > deal damage > take damage > lose hp


# trotter notes:
defend 20% reduction works
defend always rounds down?
minimize -2 does not work

for strategy it seems like 1 def isnt doing much. should have 0 or 1. firebrand deals same to def+half and sleep+half with 1 def or not
