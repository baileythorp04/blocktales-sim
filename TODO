# code fixes

move a bunch of logic in combat page into Game

throw you back to battle prep on combat refresh
    (stuff breaks when you rerender combat)

# game fixes

true infinite first stike and feelfine/pierce

# game features

make log work with undo/restart

make not enough SP/HP error better

# trotter notes:
defend 20% reduction works
defend always rounds down
minimize -2 does not work

for strategy it seems like 1 def isnt doing much. should have 0 or 1. firebrand deals same to def+half and sleep+half with 1 def or not
