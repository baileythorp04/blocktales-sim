throw you back to battle prep on combat refresh
    (stuff breaks when you rerender combat)

way advanced: instead of calling the whole list every time, just have the timed functions be altered at start of combat to the correct effects

?????? add 'allowed targets' to action (player, enemy, multiple, auto) error if targetting player with attack or enemy with heal

add list of chosen passive cards to combat UI

add a reusable function for iterating through all cards of a given type

fix strict mode (probably) useeffect triggering all start of combat effects twice
