# code fixes

move a bunch of logic in combat page into Game

throw you back to battle prep on combat refresh
    (stuff breaks when you rerender combat)

# game fixes

add list of chosen passive cards to combat UI

true infinite first stike and feelfine/pierce

# game features

for restart/undo, try passing player/enemy factory functions instead of the player itself so you dont have to clone

log (show user+enemy actions each turn, separated by turn)

items


make diagram of how an action works, with a line down the middle: card > action > deal damage > take damage > lose hp

# test for:
does unboosted sword w/ -2 debuff against +1 def up deflect?

does hitting 50% hp immediately after firebrand still summon?

# trotter notes:
defend 20% reduction works
defend always rounds down
minimize -2 does not work

for strategy it seems like 1 def isnt doing much. should have 0 or 1. firebrand deals same to def+half and sleep+half with 1 def or not
