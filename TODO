# code fixes

throw you back to battle prep on combat refresh
    (stuff breaks when you rerender combat)

way advanced: instead of calling the whole list every time, just have the timed functions be altered at start of combat to the correct effects

add a reusable function for iterating through all cards of a given type


# game fixes

add list of chosen passive cards to combat UI

fix strict mode (probably) useeffect triggering all start of combat effects twice

test how Defence Up status works with sword's pierce (does 1dmg sword pierce it or not?)
if needed for softener, implement defup/defdown countering
