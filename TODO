# code fixes

throw you back to battle prep on combat refresh
    (stuff breaks when you rerender combat)

way advanced: instead of calling the whole list every time, just have the timed functions be altered at start of combat to the correct effects

add a reusable function for iterating through all cards of a given type


# game fixes

add list of chosen passive cards to combat UI

fix strict mode (probably) useeffect triggering all start of combat effects twice

remember: def-up status cant be pierced by sword's half pierce
if needed for softener, implement defup/defdown countering

# game features

add icons to status types. show them in UI and make sure they are added correctly

change Entity to input entity object instead of all those vars (but somehow handle optional player-only vars?)

replace all times entity.hp is altered directly with a non-attack function, so it can be logged (make hp private)

test and record the attack pattern of trotter. before and after 50%hp, with and without active summon

account for 2+ first strike dmg

log (show user+enemy actions each turn, separated by turn)
status effects (show in UI, apply statuses, make statuses do anything)
trotter stances
items



# trotter notes:
defend 20% reduction works
defend always rounds down?
minimize -2 does not work

for strategy it seems like 1 def isnt doing much. should have 0 or 1. firebrand deals same to def+half and sleep+half with 1 def or not
