# code fixes

throw you back to battle prep on combat refresh
    (stuff breaks when you rerender combat)

way advanced: instead of calling the whole list every time, just have the timed functions be altered at start of combat to the correct effects

add a reusable function for iterating through all cards of a given type


# game fixes

add list of chosen passive cards to combat UI

fix strict mode (probably) useeffect triggering all start of combat effects twice

remember: def-up status cant be pierced by sword's half pierce
if needed for softener, implement defup/defdown countering

# game features

test and record the attack pattern of trotter. before and after 50%hp, with and without active summon

log (show user+enemy actions each turn, separated by turn)
status effects (show in UI, apply statuses, make statuses do anything)
trotter stances
items



# trotter notes:
defend 20% reduction works
defend always rounds down?
minimize -2 does not work

whether dmg is rounded between the 50% and 20% or not doesn't change the outcome

10 -> 5 -> 2.5 => 3 
9 -> 4.5 -> 2.25 => 2
3 damage!!! rounding does happen. (however, need to confirm 2.25 rounds down not up)
14 -> 13 -> 4

13 -> 6.5 -> 3.25 -> 4
OR
13 -> 6.5 -> 7 -> 3.5 -> 4




10 - 1 def = 9dmg
9 * 0.5 = 4.5dmg

5 * 0.8 = 4 dmg
OR
4.5 * 0.8 = 3.6 => 3dmg


9 * 0.8 = 7.2dmg

7 * 0.5 = 3.5dmg => 4dmg
OR
7.2 * 0.5 = 3.6dmg => 4dmg


1def + defend = 7dmg
1def + defend + minimize = 7dmg
1def + sleep = 5dmg

1def + half + defend = 4dmg
10 -> 9 -> 7.2 -> 7 -> 3.5 -> 4


14 -> half, defend -> 5
14 -> 13 -> 10.4 -> 10 -> 5

for strategy it seems like 1 def isnt doing much. should have 0 or 1. firebrand deals same to def+half and sleep+half with 1 def or not
